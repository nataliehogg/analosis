# analosis

Authors: Natalie B. Hogg, Pierre Fleury

The analosis package is a wrapper for lenstronomy created to investigate line-of-sight (LOS) effects in strong lensing.

Its main functionality is to simulate a large number of strong lensing images and fit them with a range of different models using an MCMC parameter inference.

An example notebook showing how to use analosis is in the notebooks directory.
